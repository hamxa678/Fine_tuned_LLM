Based on language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.[1] LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.[2]\\n\\nLLMs are artificial neural networks that utilize the transformer architecture, invented in 2017. The largest and most capable LLMs, as of June\\xa02024[update], are built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, which enables efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data.\\n\\nHistorically, up to 2020, fine-tuning was the primary method used to adapt a model for specific tasks. However, larger models such as GPT-3 have demonstrated the ability to achieve similar results through prompt engineering, which involves crafting specific input prompts to guide the model\\'s responses.[3] These models acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics, and ontologies[4] inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.[5]\\n\\nSome notable LLMs are OpenAI\\'s GPT series of models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot), Google\\'s Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), Meta\\'s LLaMA family of models, Anthropic\\'s Claude models, and Mistral AI\\'s models.\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\n\\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved then-SOTA perplexity.[6] In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"[7]), upon which they trained statistical language models.[8][9] In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.[10]\\n\\nAfter neural networks became dominant in image processing around 2012, they were applied to language modelling as well. Google converted its translation service to Neural Machine Translation in 2016. As it was before Transformers, it was done by seq2seq deep LSTM networks.\\n\\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". This paper\\'s goal was to improve upon 2014 Seq2seq technology,[11] and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[12] The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\".[13] Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model.\\n\\nAlthough decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.[14] GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024[update] is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz.[15] The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities.[16] OpenAI did not reveal high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4.\\n\\nCompeting language models have for the most part been attempting to equal the GPT series, at least in terms of number of parameters.[17]\\n\\nSince 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. Mistral AI\\'s models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have the more permissive Apache License. As of June\\xa02024[update], The Instruction fine tuned variant of the Llama 3 70 billion parameter model is the most powerful open LLM according to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, being more powerful than GPT-3.5 but not as powerful as GPT-4.[18]\\n\\nAs of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the Transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).[19][20][21]\\n\\nDataset preprocessing[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nList of datasets for machine-learning research §\\xa0Internet\\n\\nProbabilistic tokenization[edit]\\n\\nBecause machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indexes are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding and WordPiece.\\n\\nProbabilistic tokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset.[22][23]\\n\\nBPE[edit]\\n\\nUsing a modification of byte-pair encoding, in the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram repeatedly until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257).[24] Token vocabulary consists of integers, spanning from zero up to the size of the token vocabulary. New words can always be interpreted as combinations of the tokens and the initial-set uni-grams.[25]\\n\\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. An average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is however split into suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.[26]\\n\\nFor example, here is how tokenizer used by GPT-3 (Legacy) split the following sentence tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\".\\n\\ntoken izer : texts -> series of numerical \" t ok ens \"\\n\\nDataset cleaning[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nData cleansing\\n\\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing toxic passages from the dataset, discarding low-quality data, and de-duplication.[27] Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.[28][29] A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.[30]\\n\\nWith the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).[31]\\n\\nSynthetic data[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSynthetic data\\n\\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. The Microsoft\\'s Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.[32]\\n\\nTraining and architecture[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nFine-tuning (machine learning)\\n\\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)[edit]\\n\\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences.[33]\\n\\nInstruction tuning[edit]\\n\\nUsing \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be \"If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus.[34]\\n\\nMixture of experts[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nMixture of experts\\n\\nThe largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters.[35][36][37]\\n\\nPrompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nPrompt engineering and\\n\\nAttention (machine learning)\\n\\nMost results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window).[38]\\n\\n[39]\\n\\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k token.[40] In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.[25]\\n\\nThe largest models, such as Google\\'s Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\").[41] Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic\\'s Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens.[42] Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.[43]\\n\\nLength of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with ChatGPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation.\\n\\nThe shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them are a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations.\\n\\nA model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset.[44] It can be either\\n\\nautoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, the way GPTs do it): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\".\\n\\n\"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\"[45] does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.\\n\\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus.[45] During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.\\n\\nTraining cost[edit]\\n\\nAdvances in software and hardware have reduced the cost substantially since 2020, such that in 2023 training of a 12-billion-parameter LLM computational cost is 72,300 A100-GPU-hours, while in 2020 the cost of training a 1.5-billion-parameter LLM (which was two orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art in 2020) was between $80 thousand and $1.6 million.[46][47][48] Since 2020, large sums were invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million.[49]\\n\\nFor Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token.[50]\\n\\nTool use[edit]\\n\\nThere are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user\\'s input \\'354 * 139 = \\', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response. Another example is \\'What is the time now? It is \\', where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so LLM could include it in its reply.[51][52] This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies.[53]\\n\\nGenerally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must finetune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then finetuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be fine-tuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.[54][55]\\n\\nA simpler form of tool use is Retrieval Augmented Generation: augment an LLM with document retrieval, sometimes using a vector database. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant (usually measured by first encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors closest in Euclidean norm to the query vector). The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and the retrieved documents.[56]\\n\\nAgency[edit]\\n\\nAn LLM is a language model, which is not an agent as it has no goal, but it can be used as a component of an intelligent agent.[57] Researchers have described several methods for such integrations.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe ReAct (\"Reason\\xa0+\\xa0Act\") method constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment.[58] The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.[59]\\n\\nIn the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.[60]\\n\\nThe Reflexion method[61] constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.[citation needed]\\n\\nMonte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.[62]\\n\\nFor open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent.[63] Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning.[64] Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.[64]\\n\\nLLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially.[65]\\n\\nCompression[edit]\\n\\nTypically, LLM are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.[66]\\n\\nPost-training quantization[67] aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance.[68][69] The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\").[70]\\n\\nWhile quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are fine-tuned, quantized models can still be fine-tuned.[71]\\n\\nMultimodality[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nMultimodal learning\\n\\nMultimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc.[72] There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label,[73] visual question answering for image-text to text,[74] and speech recognition for speech to text.\\n\\nA common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        E\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle E}\\n  \\n. Make a small multilayered perceptron \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n  \\n, so that for any image \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n, the post-processed vector \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        E\\n        (\\n        y\\n        )\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(E(y))}\\n  \\n has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.[75]\\n\\nFlamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch.[76] Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control.[77] LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs,[78] and video inputs.[79]\\n\\nGPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs[80] (although the vision component was not released to the public until GPT-4V[81]); Google DeepMind\\'s Gemini is also multimodal.[82]\\n\\nProperties[edit]\\n\\nScaling laws[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nNeural scaling law\\n\\nThe following four hyper-parameters characterize an LLM:\\n\\ncost of (pre-)training (\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        C\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle C}\\n  \\n),\\n\\nsize of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        N\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle N}\\n  \\n (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases),\\n\\nsize of its (pre-)training dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        D\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle D}\\n  \\n),\\n\\nperformance after (pre-)training.\\n\\nThey are related by simple statistical laws, called \"scaling laws\".

There are several methods for understanding how LLM work.\\n\\nMechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLM by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by LLM. One example is Othello-GPT, where a small Transformer is trained to predict legal Othello moves. It is found that there is a linear representation of Othello board, and modifying the representation changes the predicted legal Othello moves in the correct way.[93][94] In another example, a small Transformer is trained on Karel programs. Similar to the Othello-GPT example, there is a linear representation of Karel program semantics, and modifying the representation changes output in the correct way. The model also generates correct programs that are on average shorter than those in the training set.[95]\\n\\nIn another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.[96]\\n\\nUnderstanding and intelligence[edit]\\n\\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\".[97] Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\"[98][99] Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\".[100][101] For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don\\'t push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"[102][103]\\n\\nIn contrast, some proponents of the \"LLMs lack understanding\" school believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\",[101] a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability.[97] For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning.[99] Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\".[104] Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input.[105] Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".[97]\\n\\nThe matter of LLM\\'s exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects – the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language.[97] These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL)[106] as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language.[107][108]\\n\\nEvaluation[edit]\\n\\nPerplexity[edit]\\n\\nThe most commonly used measure of a language model\\'s performance is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity is a measure of how well a model is able to predict the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. Mathematically, perplexity is defined as the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token:\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        log\\n        \\u2061\\n        (\\n        \\n          Perplexity\\n        \\n        )\\n        =\\n        −\\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            N\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            i\\n            =\\n            1\\n          \\n          \\n            N\\n          \\n        \\n        log\\n        \\u2061\\n        (\\n        Pr\\n        (\\n        \\n          \\n            token\\n          \\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        ∣\\n        \\n          \\n            context for token\\n          \\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\log({\\\\text{Perplexity}})=-{\\\\frac {1}{N}}\\\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\\\log(\\\\Pr({\\\\text{token}}_{i}\\\\mid {\\\\text{context for token}}_{i}))}\\n  \\nhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        N\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle N}\\n  \\n is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n  \\n\" depends on the specific type of LLM used. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n  \\n\" is the segment of text appearing before token \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n  \\n. If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n  \\n\" is the segment of text surrounding token \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n  \\n.\\n\\nBecause language models may overfit to their training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set of unseen data.[45] This presents particular challenges for the evaluation of large language models. As they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text largely scraped from the web, it becomes increasingly likely that models\\' training data inadvertently includes portions of any given test set.[3]\\n\\nBPW, BPC, and BPT[edit]\\n\\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon.[109] This relationship is mathematically expressed as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          Entropy\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          log\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        \\u2061\\n        (\\n        \\n          Perplexity\\n        \\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{Entropy}}=\\\\log _{2}({\\\\text{Perplexity}})}\\n  \\n.\\n\\nEntropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.\\n\\nNotably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.\\n\\nIn the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model\\'s enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model\\'s proficiency in making accurate predictions.\\n\\nTask-specific datasets and benchmarks[edit]\\n\\nA large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.\\n\\nOne broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\").[110] A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model\\'s prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"[110]). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training.[111] Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.[111]\\n\\nEvaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".[3]\\n\\nSome composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, and HELM.[109][111] OpenAI has released tools for running composite benchmarks, but noted that the eval results are sensitive to the prompting method.[112][113]\\n\\nIt was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).\\n\\nAdversarially constructed evaluations[edit]\\n\\nBecause of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks.[114] In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.[97]\\n\\nSome datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can\\'t teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.[115]\\n\\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example:\\n\\nWe see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man...\\n\\na) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls.\\n\\nb) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle.\\n\\nc) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration.\\n\\nd) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.\\n\\n[116]\\n\\nBERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d).[116]\\n\\nWider impact[edit]\\n\\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\"[117] Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally.[118][119]\\n\\nMemorization and copyright[edit]\\n\\nFurther information: \\n\\nArtificial intelligence and copyright\\n\\nMemorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates[120] or up to about 7%.[121]\\n\\nSecurity[edit]\\n\\nSome commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse.[122] For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.[123]\\n\\nA study by researchers at Google and several universities, including Cornell University and University of California, Berkeley, showed that there are potential security risks in language models such as ChatGPT. In their study, they examined and confirmed the possibility that questioners could get, from ChatGPT, the training data that the AI model used. For example, when asking ChatGPT 3.5 turbo to repeat the word \"poem\" forever, the AI model will say \"poem\" hundreds of times and then diverge, deviating from the standard dialogue style and spitting out nonsense phrases, thus spitting out the training data as it is. The researchers have seen more than 10,000 examples of the AI model exposing their training data in a similar method. The researchers said that it was hard to tell if the AI model was actually safe or not.[124]\\n\\nThe potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLM models is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions.[125]\\n\\nLarge language model (LLM) applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, research by Kang et al. [126]  demonstrated a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. Similarly, Wang\\n[127] illustrated how a potential criminal could potentially bypass ChatGPT 4o\\'s safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation.\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nAlgorithmic bias\\n\\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups.[128] Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models\\' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.[129]\\n\\nStereotyping[edit]\\n\\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.[130]\\n\\nNotably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms.[128] For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men.[131]\\n\\nPolitical bias[edit]\\n\\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.[132]\\n\\nList[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nList of chatbots\\n\\nFor the training cost column, 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP/sec × 1 day = 8.64E19 FLOP.\\n\\nName Release date [a] Developer Number of parameters (billion) [b] Corpus size Training cost (petaFLOP-day) License [c] Notes GPT-1 June 2018 OpenAI 0.117 1 [133] MIT [134] First GPT model, decoder-only transformer.

Adherents of Islam are called\\n\\nMuslims, who are estimated to number approximately\\n\\n1.9 billion worldwide and are the world\\'s\\n\\nsecond-largest religious population after\\n\\nChristians.\\n\\n[8]\\n\\nprimordial faith that was revealed many times through earlier\\n\\nprophets and messengers, including\\n\\nAdam,\\n\\nNoah,\\n\\nAbraham,\\n\\nMoses, and\\n\\nJesus. Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of\\n\\nGod and the unaltered, final revelation. Alongside the Quran, Muslims also believe in previous\\n\\nrevelations, such as the\\n\\nTawrat (the\\n\\nTorah), the\\n\\nZabur (\\n\\nPsalms), and the\\n\\nInjil (\\n\\nGospel). They believe that\\n\\nMuhammad is the main and\\n\\nfinal Islamic prophet, through whom the religion was completed. The teachings and normative examples of Muhammad, called the\\n\\nsunnah, documented in accounts called the\\n\\nhadith, provide a constitutional model for Muslims. Islam emphasizes that God is\\n\\none and incomparable. It states that there will be a \"\\n\\nFinal Judgment\" wherein the righteous will be rewarded in paradise (\\n\\njannah) and the unrighteous will be punished in hell (\\n\\njahannam). The\\n\\nFive Pillars—considered\\n\\nobligatory acts of worship—comprise the Islamic oath and creed (\\n\\nshahada); daily prayers (\\n\\nsalah); almsgiving (\\n\\nzakat); fasting (\\n\\nsawm) in the month of\\n\\nRamadan; and a pilgrimage (\\n\\nhajj) to\\n\\nMecca. Islamic law,\\n\\nsharia, touches on virtually every aspect of life, from\\n\\nbanking and finance and\\n\\nwelfare to\\n\\nmen\\'s and\\n\\nwomen\\'s roles and the\\n\\nenvironment. The two main religious festivals are\\n\\nEid al-Fitr and\\n\\nEid al-Adha. The three\\n\\nholiest sites in Islam are\\n\\nMasjid al-Haram in Mecca,\\n\\nProphet\\'s Mosque in\\n\\nMedina, and\\n\\nal-Aqsa Mosque in\\n\\nJerusalem.\\n\\nCE. Muslims believe this is when\\n\\nMuhammad received his first revelation. By the time of his death, most of the\\n\\nArabian Peninsula had\\n\\nconverted to Islam. Muslim rule expanded outside Arabia under the\\n\\nRashidun Caliphate and the subsequent\\n\\nUmayyad Caliphate ruled from the\\n\\nIberian Peninsula to the\\n\\nIndus Valley. In the\\n\\nIslamic Golden Age, specifically during the reign of the\\n\\nAbbasid Caliphate, much of the Muslim world experienced a\\n\\nscientific,\\n\\neconomic and\\n\\ncultural flourishing. The\\n\\nexpansion of the Muslim world involved\\n\\nvarious states and caliphates as well as extensive trade and religious conversion as a result of\\n\\nIslamic missionary activities (\\n\\ndawah), as well as through\\n\\nconquests.\\n\\nIslamic branches are\\n\\nSunni Islam (85–90%) and\\n\\nShia Islam (10–15%). While the\\n\\nShia–Sunni divide initially arose from disagreements over the\\n\\nsuccession to Muhammad, they grew to cover a broader dimension, both\\n\\ntheologically and\\n\\njuridically. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 49 countries. Approximately 12% of the world\\'s Muslims live\\n\\nin Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country; 31% live\\n\\nin South Asia; 20% live\\n\\nin the Middle East–North Africa; and 15% live\\n\\nin sub-Saharan Africa.

Consciousness and awareness of God is referred to as Taqwa. Allāh is a term with no plural or gender being ascribed to it and is also used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews in reference to God, whereas ʾilāh (إله) is a term used for a deity or a god in general.[24]\\n\\nAngels\\n\\nSiyer-i Nebi image of the angel\\n\\nGabriel visiting Muhammad\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nAngels in Islam\\n\\nملك,\\n\\nmalak\\n\\n[25]\\n\\n[26]\\n\\nrevelations from God, recording every person\\'s actions, and taking a person\\'s\\n\\nsoul at the time of death.

However, Islam teaches that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, such as the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel), have become distorted—either in interpretation, in text, or both,[50][51][52][53] while the Quran (lit. \\'Recitation\\') is viewed as the final, verbatim and unaltered word of God.[44][54][55][56]\\n\\nProphets\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nProphets and messengers in Islam,\\n\\nSunnah, and\\n\\nHadith\\n\\n[57]\\n\\nPersian miniature depicting\\n\\nMuhammad leading\\n\\nAbraham,\\n\\nMoses,\\n\\nJesus and other prophets in prayer\\n\\nProphets (Arabic: أنبياء, anbiyāʾ) are believed to have been chosen by God to preach a divine message. Some of these prophets additionally deliver a new book and are called \"messengers\" (رسول\\u200e, rasūl).[58] Muslims believe prophets are human and not divine. All of the prophets are said to have preached the same basic message of Islam – submission to the will of God – to various nations in the past, and this is said to account for many similarities among religions. The Quran recounts the names of numerous figures considered prophets in Islam, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, among others.[9][59] The stories associated with the prophets beyond the Quranic accounts are collected and explored in the Qisas al-Anbiya (Stories of the Prophets).\\n\\nSeal of the prophets\") to convey the completed message of Islam.\\n\\n[60]\\n\\n[61]\\n\\nsunnah\\n\\n[62]\\n\\n[63]\\n\\n[64]\\n\\n[65]\\n\\nhadith, which are accounts of his words, actions, and personal characteristics.\\n\\nHadith Qudsi is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as God\\'s verbatim words quoted by Muhammad that are not part of the Quran.

It is believed that the time of Qiyāmah is preordained by God, but unknown to man. The Quran and the hadith, as well as the commentaries of scholars, describe the trials and tribulations preceding and during the Qiyāmah. The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.[69][70][71]\\n\\nJannah\\n\\nJahannam\\n\\n[72]\\n\\nSurat al-Zalzalah describes this as: \"So whoever does an atom\\'s weight of good will see it.

Al-qadar, meaning \"power\", derives from a root that means \"to measure\" or \"calculating\".[77][78][79][80] Muslims often express this belief in divine destiny with the phrase \"In-sha-Allah\" (Arabic: إن شاء الله) meaning \"if God wills\" when speaking on future events.[81]\\n\\nActs of worship\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nFive Pillars of Islam and\\n\\nIbadah\\n\\nThere are five acts of worship that are considered duties – the Shahada (declaration of faith), the five daily prayers, Zakat (alms-giving), fasting during Ramadan and the Hajj pilgrimage – collectively known as \"The Pillars of Islam\" (Arkān al-Islām).[82] In addition, Muslims also perform other optional supererogatory acts that are encouraged but not considered to be duties.[83]\\n\\nDeclaration of faith\\n\\nMughal Emperor\\n\\nAkbar, c. 16th century, inscribed with the\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nShahada\\n\\nThe shahadah[84] is an oath declaring belief in Islam. The expanded statement is \"ʾašhadu ʾal-lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu wa ʾašhadu ʾanna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh\" (أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله), or, \"I testify that there is no deity except God and I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God.\"[85] Islam is sometimes argued to have a very simple creed with the shahada being the premise for the rest of the religion. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the shahada in front of witnesses.[86][87]\\n\\nPrayer\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSalah\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nMosque and\\n\\nJumu\\'ah\\n\\nprostrating in prayer, at the\\n\\nUmayyad Mosque,\\n\\nDamascus\\n\\nPrayer in Islam, called as-salah or aṣ-ṣalāt (Arabic: الصلاة), is seen as a personal communication with God and consists of repeating units called rakat that include bowing and prostrating to God. There are five timed prayers each day that are considered duties. The prayers are recited in the Arabic language and performed in the direction of the Kaaba. The act also requires a state of ritual purity achieved by means of either a routine wudu ritual wash or, in certain circumstances, a ghusl full body ritual wash.[88][89][90][91]\\n\\nA mosque is a place of worship for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name masjid. Although the primary purpose of the mosque is to serve as a place of prayer, it is also an important social center for the Muslim community. For example, the Masjid an-Nabawi (\"Prophetic Mosque\") in Medina, Saudi Arabia, used to also serve as a shelter for the poor.[92] Minarets are towers used to call the adhan, a vocal call to signal the prayer time.[93][94]\\n\\nAlmsgiving\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nZakat\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nSadaqah\\n\\nZawiya of Moulay Idris II in\\n\\nFez, Morocco\\n\\nZakat (\\n\\nArabic:\\n\\nزكاة,\\n\\nzakāh), also spelled\\n\\nalmsgiving characterized by the giving of a fixed portion (2.5% annually)\\n\\n[95]\\n\\naccumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy, such as for freeing captives, those in\\n\\ndebt, or for (stranded) travellers, and for those employed to collect zakat.

During the month of Ramadan, it is considered a duty for Muslims to fast.[103] The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God by restraining oneself for God\\'s sake from what is otherwise permissible and to think of the needy. In addition, there are other days, such as the Day of Arafah, when fasting is optional.[104]\\n\\nPilgrimage\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nHajj and\\n\\nUmrah\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nHoliest sites in Islam\\n\\nGreat Mosque of Mecca during the\\n\\nHajj season\\n\\npilgrimage, called the \"\\n\\nḥajj\" (Arabic:\\n\\nحج), is to be done at least once a lifetime by every Muslim with the means to do so during the\\n\\nIslamic month of\\n\\nDhu al-Hijjah. Rituals of the Hajj mostly imitate the story of the family of\\n\\nAbraham.

A symbiosis between Ottoman rulers and Sufism strongly influenced Islamic reign by the Ottomans from the beginning. The Mevlevi Order and Bektashi Order had a close relation to the sultans,[219] as Sufi-mystical as well as heterodox and syncretic approaches to Islam flourished.[220] The often forceful Safavid conversion of Iran to the Twelver Shia Islam of the Safavid Empire ensured the final dominance of the Twelver sect within Shia Islam. Persian migrants to South Asia, as influential bureaucrats and landholders, helped spread Shia Islam, forming some of the largest Shia populations outside Iran.[221] Nader Shah, who overthrew the Safavids, attempted to improve relations with Sunnis by propagating the integration of Twelverism into Sunni Islam as a fifth madhhab, called Ja\\'farism,[222] which failed to gain recognition from the Ottomans.[223]\\n\\nModern era (18th–20th centuries)\\n\\nAbdülmecid II was the last Caliph of Islam from the\\n\\nOttoman dynasty.\\n\\nIbn Taymiyya promoted a\\n\\npuritanical form of Islam,\\n\\n[224]\\n\\n[224]\\n\\nitjihad rather than blind imitation of scholars.\\n\\n[225]\\n\\n[226]\\n\\n[227]\\n\\nMuhammad ibn \\'Abd al-Wahhab, influenced by the works of Ibn Taymiyya and\\n\\nIbn al-Qayyim, founded a movement called\\n\\nWahhabi to return to what he saw as unadultered Islam.\\n\\n[228]\\n\\n[229]\\n\\ninnovations and sinful\\n\\n[229]\\n\\n[230]\\n\\ntombs of Muhammad and his companions and the tomb of Husayn at Karbala, a major Shia pilgrimage site.\\n\\n[230]\\n\\n[231]\\n\\n[232]\\n\\nSaud family, which, by the 1920s, completed their conquest of the area that would become\\n\\nSaudi Arabia.\\n\\n[230]\\n\\n[233]\\n\\nMa Wanfu and Ma Debao promoted salafist movements in the 19th century such as\\n\\nSailaifengye in China after returning from Mecca but were eventually persecuted and forced into hiding by Sufi groups.\\n\\n[234]\\n\\nSenusiyya and\\n\\nMuhammad Ahmad both waging war and establishing states in Libya and Sudan respectively.\\n\\n[235]\\n\\nShah Waliullah Dehlawi attempted a more conciliatory style against Sufism and influenced the\\n\\nDeobandi movement.\\n\\n[236]\\n\\nBarelwi movement was founded as a mass movement, defending popular\\n\\nSufism and reforming its practices.\\n\\n[237]\\n\\n[238]\\n\\nMuslim world was generally in political decline starting the 1800s, especially compared to non-Muslim European powers.

Many Muslims migrated as indentured servants (mostly from India and Indonesia) to the Caribbean, forming the largest Muslim populations by percentage in the Americas.[252] Migration from Syria and Lebanon contributed to the Muslim population in Latin America.[253] The resulting urbanization and increase in trade in sub-Saharan Africa brought Muslims to settle in new areas and spread their faith,[254] likely doubling its Muslim population between 1869 and 1914.[255]\\n\\nContemporary era (20th century–present)\\n\\nIslamic Summit Conference in Istanbul, Turkey\\n\\nMuslim Brotherhood and related parties in the Arab world,\\n\\n[256]\\n\\n[257]\\n\\nArab Spring,\\n\\n[258]\\n\\nJamaat-e-Islami in South Asia and the\\n\\nAK Party, which has democratically been in power in Turkey for decades.

For example, in Saudi Arabia, the state monopolized religious scholarship[264] and, in Egypt, the state nationalized Al-Azhar University, previously an independent voice checking state power.[265] Salafism was funded in the Middle East for its quietism.[266] Saudi Arabia campaigned against revolutionary Islamist movements in the Middle East, in opposition to Iran.[267]\\n\\nMuslim minorities of various ethnicities have been persecuted as a religious group.[268] This has been undertaken by communist forces like the Khmer Rouge, who viewed them as their primary enemy to be exterminated since their religious practice made them stand out from the rest of the population,[269] the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang[270] and by nationalist forces such as during the Bosnian genocide.[271] Myanmar military\\'s Tatmadaw targeting of Rohingya Muslims has been labeled as a crime against humanity by the UN and Amnesty International,[272][273] while the OHCHR Fact-Finding Mission identified genocide, ethnic cleansing, and other crimes against humanity.[274]\\n\\nhijab has grown more common\\n\\n[275]\\n\\n[276]\\n\\ntelevangelist\" preachers, such as\\n\\nAmr Khaled, who compete with the traditional\\n\\nulema in their reach and have decentralized religious authority.\\n\\n[277]\\n\\n[278]\\n\\n[279]\\n\\nLiberal Muslims who attempt to align religious traditions with contemporary secular governance,\\n\\n[280]\\n\\n[281]\\n\\n[282]\\n\\n[283]\\n\\nruling elites,\\n\\n[284]\\n\\nanti-religion.\\n\\n[285]\\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nMuslim world and\\n\\nUmmah\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nIslam by country and\\n\\nMuslim population growth\\n\\n[286]\\n\\n[6]\\n\\n[8]\\n\\n[287]\\n\\n[288]\\n\\n[289]\\n\\n[290]\\n\\n[291]\\n\\n[254]\\n\\n[292]\\n\\nPew Research Center estimates that 87–90% of Muslims are Sunni and 10–13% are Shia.\\n\\n[293]\\n\\nMuslim-majority,\\n\\n[294]\\n\\n[295]\\n\\n[296]\\n\\n[297]\\n\\n[298]\\n\\n[299]\\n\\nIndonesia,\\n\\n[300]\\n\\nPakistan,\\n\\nIndia, and\\n\\nBangladesh alone.\\n\\n[301]\\n\\n[302]\\n\\n[303]\\n\\nArab Muslims form the\\n\\nlargest ethnic group among Muslims in the world,\\n\\n[304]\\n\\nBengalis\\n\\n[305]\\n\\n[306]\\n\\nPunjabis.\\n\\n[307]\\n\\nChina has approximately 20 to 30 million Muslims (1.5% to 2% of the population).\\n\\n[308]\\n\\n[309]\\n\\nIslam in Europe is the second-largest religion after\\n\\nChristianity in many countries, with growth rates due primarily to immigration and higher birth rates of Muslims in 2005,\\n\\n[310]\\n\\n[311]\\n\\nReligious conversion has no net impact on the Muslim population growth as \"the number of people who become Muslims through conversion seems to be roughly equal to the number of Muslims who leave the faith.\"[312] Although, Islam is expected to experience a modest gain of 3 million through religious conversion between 2010 and 2050, mostly from Sub Saharan Africa (2.9 million).[313][314]\\n\\nAccording to a report by CNN, \"Islam has drawn converts from all walks of life, most notably African-Americans\".[315] In Britain, around 6,000 people convert to Islam per year and, according to an article in the British Muslims Monthly Survey, the majority of new Muslim converts in Britain were women.[316] According to The Huffington Post, \"observers estimate that as many as 20,000 Americans convert to Islam annually\", most of them being women and African-Americans.[317][318]\\n\\nBy both percentage and total numbers, Islam is the world\\'s fastest growing major religious group, and is projected to be the world\\'s largest by the end of the 21st century, surpassing that of Christianity.[319][292] It is estimated that, by 2050, the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world, \"due to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims relative to other religious groups.\"[292]\\n\\nMain branches or denominations\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nIslamic schools and branches §\\xa0Main branches or denominations\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nShia–Sunni relations\\n\\nSunni\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSunni Islam\\n\\nSahih Al-Bukhari, one of the\\n\\nsix Sunni hadith books\\n\\nSunni Islam, or Sunnism, is the name for the largest denomination in Islam.[320][321][322] The term is a contraction of the phrase \"ahl as-sunna wa\\'l-jamaat\", which means \"people of the sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) and the community\".[323] Sunnis, or sometimes Sunnites, believe that the first four caliphs were the rightful successors to Muhammad and primarily reference six major hadith works for legal matters, while following one of the four traditional schools of jurisprudence: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki or Shafi\\'i.[324][325]\\n\\nThe adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jamāʻah (\"the people of the Sunnah and the community\") or ahl as-Sunnah for short. In English, its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism.[326] Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as \"orthodox Islam\",[327][328][329] though some scholars view this as inappropriate, and many non-Sunnis may find this offensive.[330]\\n\\nTraditionalist theology is a Sunni school of thought, prominently advocated by Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780–855 CE), that is characterized by its adherence to a textualist understanding of the Quran and the sunnah, the belief that the Quran is uncreated and eternal, and opposition to speculative theology, called kalam, in religious and ethical matters.[331] Mu\\'tazilism is a Sunni school of thought inspired by Ancient Greek Philosophy. Maturidism, founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (853–944 CE), asserts that scripture is not needed for basic ethics and that good and evil can be understood by reason alone,[332] but people rely on revelation, for matters beyond human\\'s comprehension. Ash\\'arism, founded by Al-Ashʿarī (c. 874–936), holds that ethics can derive just from divine revelation but accepts reason regarding exegetical matters and combines Muʿtazila approaches with traditionalist ideas.[333]\\n\\nSalafism is a revival movement advocating the return to the practices of the earliest generations of Muslims. In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab led a Salafi movement, referred by outsiders as Wahhabism, in modern-day Saudi Arabia.[334] A similar movement called Ahl al-Hadith also de-emphasized the centuries\\' old Sunni legal tradition, preferring to directly follow the Quran and Hadith. The Nurcu Sunni movement was by Said Nursi (1877–1960);[335] it incorporates elements of Sufism and science.[335][336]\\n\\nShia\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nShia Islam\\n\\nNahj al-balagha, collection of sermons, letters, and sayings attributed to\\n\\nImam Ali.\\n\\n[337]\\n\\n[338]\\n\\n[293]\\n\\nsuccessor as leader, must be from certain descendants of Muhammad\\'s family known as the\\n\\nAhl al-Bayt and those leaders, referred to as\\n\\nImams, have additional spiritual authority.\\n\\n[339]\\n\\n[340]\\n\\nGhadir Khumm during Muhammad\\'s return from his final pilgrimage to Mecca.

They recognise that the prophecy of the Twelve Imams has been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors which is recorded by both Sunni and Shia sources.[352] Zaidism rejects special powers of Imams and are sometimes considered a \\'fifth school\\' of Sunni Islam rather than a Shia denomination.[353][354] They differed with other Shias over the status of the fifth imam and are sometimes known as \"Fivers\".[355] The Isma\\'ilis split with the Twelvers over who was the seventh Imam and have split into more groups over the status of successive Imams, with the largest group being the Nizaris.[356]\\n\\nMuhakkima\\n\\nMain articles: \\n\\nMuhakkima,\\n\\nIbadi Islam, and\\n\\nKharijites\\n\\nIbadi Islam or Ibadism is practised by 1.45\\xa0million Muslims around the world (~0.08% of all Muslims), most of them in Oman.[357] Ibadism is often associated with and viewed as a moderate variation of the kharijites, though Ibadis themselves object to this classification. The kharijites were groups that rebelled against Caliph Ali for his acceptance of arbitration with someone they viewed as a sinner. Unlike most kharijite groups, Ibadism does not regard sinful Muslims as unbelievers. Ibadi hadiths, such as the Jami Sahih collection, use chains of narrators from early Islamic history they consider trustworthy, but most Ibadi hadiths are also found in standard Sunni collections and contemporary Ibadis often approve of the standard Sunni collections.[358]\\n\\nOther denominations\\n\\nThe Ahmadiyya Movement was founded in British India in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, who claimed to be the promised Messiah (\"Second Coming of Christ\"), the Mahdi awaited by the Muslims as well as a \"subordinate\" prophet to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.[359][360] There are a wide variety of distinct beliefs and teachings of Ahmadis compared to those of most other Muslims,[359][361][362][360] which include the interpretation of the Quranic title Khatam an-Nabiyyin[363] and interpretation of the Messiah\\'s Second Coming.[361][364] These perceived deviations from normative Islamic thought have resulted in rejection by most Muslims as heretics[365] and persecution of Ahmadis in various countries,[361] particularly Pakistan,[361][366] where they have been officially declared as non-Muslims by the Government of Pakistan.[367] The followers of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam are divided into two groups: the first being the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, currently the dominant group, and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam.[361]\\n\\nAlevism is a syncretic and heterodox local Islamic tradition, whose adherents follow the mystical (bāṭenī) teachings of Ali and Haji Bektash Veli.[368] Alevism is a blend of traditional 14th century Turkish beliefs,[369] with possible syncretist origins in Shamanism and Animism, alongside Shia and Sufi beliefs. It has been estimated that there are 10 million to over 20 million (~0.5–1% of all Muslims) Alevis worldwide.[370]\\n\\nQuranism is a religious movement of Islam based on the belief that Islamic law and guidance should only be based on the Quran and not the sunnah or Hadith,[371] with Quranists notably differing in their approach to the five pillars of Islam.[372] The movement developed from the 19th century onwards, with thinkers like Syed Ahmad Khan, Abdullah Chakralawi and Ghulam Ahmed Perwez in India questioning the hadith tradition.[373] In Egypt, Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi penned the article Islam is the Quran alone in the magazine Al-Manār, arguing for the sole authority of the Quran.[374] A prominent late 20th century Quranist was Rashad Khalifa, an Egyptian-American biochemist who claimed to have discovered a numerological code in the Quran, and founded the Quranist organization United Submitters International.[375]\\n\\nNon-denominational Muslims\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nNon-denominational Muslim\\n\\nNon-denominational Muslims is an umbrella term that has been used for and by Muslims who do not belong to or do not self-identify with a specific Islamic denomination.[376][377] Recent surveys report that large proportions of Muslims in some parts of the world self-identify as \"just Muslim\", although there is little published analysis available regarding the motivations underlying this response.[378][379][380] The Pew Research Center reports that respondents self-identifying as \"just Muslim\" make up a majority of Muslims in seven countries (and a plurality in three others), with the highest proportion in Kazakhstan at 74%.

In Arabic, the term sharīʿah refers to God\\'s divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its scholarly interpretations.[403][404] The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.[324]\\n\\ntheory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four\\n\\nsources of sharia: the Quran, sunnah (\\n\\nSira),\\n\\nqiyas (analogical reasoning), and\\n\\nijma\\n\\n[405]\\n\\nlegal schools developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as\\n\\nijtihad\\n\\n[403]\\n\\nʿibādāt\\n\\nmuʿāmalāt\\n\\n[403]\\n\\nahkam: mandatory (\\n\\nfard\\n\\nmustahabb\\n\\nmubah\\n\\nmakruh\\n\\nharam\\n\\n[403]\\n\\n[404]\\n\\n[406]\\n\\n[407]\\n\\n[404]\\n\\nmuftis).

Islamic teachings strongly advise that if a man cannot ensure equal financial and emotional support for each of his wives, it is recommended that he marry just one woman. One reason cited for polygyny is that it allows a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows). However, the first wife can set a condition in the marriage contract that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage.[447][448] There are also cultural variations in weddings.[449] Polyandry, a practice wherein a woman takes on two or more husbands, is prohibited in Islam.[450]\\n\\nShia Muslim girls studying the\\n\\nQuran placed atop folding\\n\\nlecterns (\\n\\nrehal) during\\n\\nRamadan in\\n\\nQom,\\n\\nIran\\n\\nAfter the birth of a child, the adhan is pronounced in the right ear.[451] On the seventh day, the aqiqah ceremony is performed, in which an animal is sacrificed and its meat is distributed among the poor.[452] The child\\'s head is shaved, and an amount of money equaling the weight of its hair is donated to the poor.[452] Male circumcision, called khitan,[453] is often practised in the Muslim world.[454][455] Respecting and obeying one\\'s parents, and taking care of them especially in their old age is a religious obligation.[456]\\n\\nA dying Muslim is encouraged to pronounce the Shahada as their last words.[457] Paying respects to the dead and attending funerals in the community are considered among the virtuous acts. In Islamic burial rituals, burial is encouraged as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours. The body is washed, except for martyrs, by members of the same gender and enshrouded in a garment that must not be elaborate called kafan.[458] A \"funeral prayer\" called Salat al-Janazah is performed. Wailing, or loud, mournful outcrying, is discouraged. Coffins are often not preferred and graves are often unmarked, even for kings.[459]\\n\\nArts and culture\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nIslamic culture\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nIslamic art,\\n\\nIslamic architecture,\\n\\nIslamic literature,\\n\\nIslam in association football, and\\n\\nCultural Muslims\\n\\nThe term \"Islamic culture\" can be used to mean aspects of culture that pertain to the religion, such as festivals and dress code.

Early criticism came from Jewish authors, such as Ibn Kammuna, and Christian authors, many of whom viewed Islam as a Christian heresy or a form of idolatry, often explaining it in apocalyptic terms.[483]\\n\\nChristian writers criticized Islam\\'s sensual descriptions of paradise. Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari defended the Quranic description of paradise by asserting that the Bible also implies such ideas, such as drinking wine in the Gospel of Matthew. Catholic theologian Augustine of Hippo\\'s doctrines led to the broad repudiation of bodily pleasure in both life and the afterlife. [484]\\n\\nDefamatory images of Muhammad, derived from early 7th century depictions of the Byzantine Church,[485] appear in the 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.[486] Here, Muhammad is depicted in the eighth circle of hell, along with Ali. Dante does not blame Islam as a whole but accuses Muhammad of schism, by establishing another religion after Christianity.[486]\\n\\nOther criticisms center on the treatment of individuals within modern Muslim-majority countries, including issues related to human rights, particularly in relation to the application of Islamic law.[487] Furthermore, in the wake of the recent multiculturalism trend, Islam\\'s influence on the ability of Muslim immigrants in the West to assimilate has been criticized.[488]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nGlossary of Islam\\n\\nIndex of Islam-related articles\\n\\nIslamic mythology\\n\\nIslamic studies\\n\\nMajor religious groups\\n\\nOutline of Islam\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n^ \"Hasan al Basri is often considered one of the first who rejected an angelic origin for the devil, arguing that his fall was the result of his own free-will, not God\\'s determination.

Beginning with Louis Massignon in 1919, it is true that Westerners played a leading role in labeling Islamic modernists as Salafis, even though the term was a misnomer. At the time, European and American scholars felt the need for a useful conceptual box to place Muslim figures such as Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and their epigones, all of whom seemed inclined toward a scripturalist understanding of Islam but proved open to rationalism and Western modernity. They chose to adopt salafiyya—a technical term of theology, which they mistook for a reformist slogan and wrongly associated with all kinds of modernist Muslim intellectuals.\\n\\n^ \"Political Islam: A movement in motion\".

Prior to the fall of the Ottoman Empire, leading reformers who happened to be Salafi in creed were surprisingly open-minded: although they adhered to neo-Hanbali theology. However, the aftermath of the First World War and the expansion of European colonialism paved the way for a series of shifts in thought and attitude. The experiences of Rida offer many examples... he turned against the Shi\\'is who dared, with reason, to express doubts about the Saudi-Wahhabi project... . Shi\\'is were not the only victims: Rida and his associates showed their readiness to turn against fellow Salafis who questioned some of the Wahhabis\\' religious interpretations.\\n\\n^ G. Rabil, Robert (2014). Salafism in Lebanon: From Apoliticism to Transnational Jihadism. Washington DC, US: Georgetown University Press. pp.\\xa032–33. ISBN\\xa0978-1-62616-116-0. Western colonialists established in these countries political orders... that, even though not professing enmity to Islam and its institutions, left no role for Islam in society. This caused a crisis among Muslim reformists, who felt betrayed not only by the West but also by those nationalists, many of whom were brought to power by the West...  Nothing reflects this crisis more than the ideological transformation of Rashid Rida (1865–1935)... He also revived the works of Ibn Taymiyah by publishing his writings and promoting his ideas. Subsequently, taking note of the cataclysmic events brought about by Western policies in the Muslim world and shocked by the abolition of the caliphate, he transformed into a Muslim intellectual mostly concerned about protecting Muslim culture, identity, and politics from Western influence. He supported a theory that essentially emphasized the necessity of an Islamic state in which the scholars of Islam would have a leading role... Rida was a forerunner of Islamist thought. He apparently intended to provide a theoretical platform for a modern Islamic state. His ideas were later incorporated into the works of Islamic scholars. Significantly, his ideas influenced none other than Hassan al-Bannah, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt... The Muslim Brethren have taken up Rida\\'s Islamic fundamentalism, a right-wing radical movement founded in 1928,..\\n\\n^ \"Isis to mint own Islamic dinar coins in gold, silver and copper\".
